# E01b-Smiles
Aaron Worthington, 2019

These files have been edited so that the faces are drawn in the center of the window, the same throughout all files.
The files all [should] have the same offset throughout, making the faces in identical places. 
However, in main5.py, comments have been added on nearly every line, explaining what each line is doing in the program, how they all complement each other and how it all works, making the smiley face follow the mouse inside of the window.

The grading criteria will be as follows:

* [1 point] Repository contains an appropriate software license
* [1 point] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
* [8] Accomplishes the objective of the exercise

10 points total
